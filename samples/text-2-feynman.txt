	THEN I HAD ANOTHER THOUGHT: PHYSICS DISGUSTS ME A LITTLE BIT NOW, BUT I USED TO ENJOY DOING PHYSICS. WHY DID I ENJOY IT? I USED TO PLAY WITH IT. I USED TO DO WHATEVER I FELT LIKE DOING-IT DID NOT HAVE TO DO WITH WHETHER IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS, BUT WHETHER IT WAS INTERESTING AND AMUSING FOR ME TO PLAY WITH. WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, I WOULD SEE WATER RUNNING OUT OF A FAUCET GROWING NARROWER, AND WONDER IF I COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT DETERMINES THAT CURVE. I FOUND IT WAS RATHER EASY TO DO. I DID NOT HAVE TO DO IT; IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE OF SCIENCE; SOMEBODY ELSE HAD ALREADY DONE IT. THAT DID NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. I WOULD INVENT THINGS AND PLAY WITH THINGS FOR MY OWN ENTERTAINMENT.

SO I GOT THIS NEW ATTITUDE. NOW THAT I AM BURNED OUT AND I WILL NEVER ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING, I HAVE GOT THIS NICE POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY TEACHING CLASSES WHICH I RATHER ENJOY, AND JUST LIKE I READ THE ARABIAN NIGHTS FOR PLEASURE, I AM GOING TO PLAY WITH PHYSICS, WHENEVER I WANT TO, WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT ANY IMPORTANCE WHATSOEVER.

WITHIN A WEEK I WAS IN THE CAFETERIA AND SOME GUY, FOOLING AROUND, THROWS A PLATE IN THE AIR. AS THE PLATE WENT UP IN THE AIR I SAW IT WOBBLE, AND I NOTICED THE RED MEDALLION  ON THE PLATE GOING AROUND. IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS TO ME THAT IT WENT AROUND FASTER THAN THE WOBBLING.

I HAD NOTHING TO DO, SO I START TO FIGURE OUT THE MOTION OF THE ROTATING PLATE. I DISCOVER THAT WHEN THE ANGLE IS VERY SLIGHT, THE MEDALLION ROTATES TWICE AS FAST AS THE WOBBLE RATE â€“ TWO TO ONE. IT CAME OUT OF A COMPLICATED EQUATION! THEN I THOUGHT, "IS THERE SOME WAY I CAN SEE IN A MORE FUNDAMENTAL WAY, BY LOOKING AT THE FORCES OR THE DYNAMICS, WHY IS IT TWO TO ONE?"

I DO NOT REMEMBER HOW I DID IT, BUT I ULTIMATELY WORKED OUT WHAT THE MOTION OF THE MASS PARTICLES IS, AND HOW ALL THE ACCELERATIONS BALANCE TO MAKE IT COME OUT TWO TO ONE.

I STILL REMEMBER GOING TO A SCIENTIST AND SAYING, "HEY,  I NOTICED SOMETHING INTERESTING. HERE THE PLATE GOES AROUND SO, AND THE REASON IT IS TWO TO ONE IS..." AND I SHOWED HIM THE ACCELERATIONS.

HE SAYS, "THAT IS PRETTY INTERESTING, BUT WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF IT? WHY ARE YOU DOING IT?"

"HAH!" I SAY. "THERE IS NO IMPORTANCE WHATSOEVER. I AM JUST DOING IT FOR THE FUN OF IT." HIS REACTION DID NOT DISCOURAGE ME; I HAD MADE UP MY MIND I WAS GOING TO ENJOY PHYSICS AND DO WHATEVER I LIKED.

I WENT ON TO WORK OUT EQUATIONS OF WOBBLES. THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW ELECTRON ORBITS START TO MOVE IN RELATIVITY. THEN THERE IS AN QUATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS. AND THEN QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS. AND BEFORE I KNEW IT (IT WAS A VERY SHORT TIME) I WAS PLAYING, WORKING, REALLY WITH THE SAME OLD PROBLEM THAT I LOVED SO MUCH, THAT I HAD STOPPED WORKING ON WHEN I WENT TO LOS ALAMOS: MY THESIS-TYPE PROBLEMS; ALL THOSE OLD-FASHIONED, WONDERFUL THINGS.

IT WAS EFFORTLESS. IT WAS EASY TO PLAY WITH THESE THINGS. IT WAS LIKE UNCORKING A BOTTLE: EVERYTHING FLOWED OUT EFFORTLESSLY. I ALMOST TRIED TO RESIST IT! THERE WAS NO IMPORTANCE TO WHAT I WAS DOING, BUT ULTIMATELY THERE WAS. THE DIAGRAMS AND THE WHOLE BUSINESS THAT I GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR CAME FROM THAT PIDDLING AROUND WITH THE WOBBLING PLATE.
